          a: "When a request is posted, our matching engine filters our network by blood group, eligibility, distance, and preferences — and pushes a notification to every donor who fits. The first to accept is locked in; others remain on warm standby for additional units."
        },
        {
          q: "How fast is a donor matched after posting a request?",

          q: "How does the 60-day safety cooldown work?",
          a: "To protect donor health, our platform enforces a strict 60-day recovery window after whole blood donation (90 days for certain criteria). Donors on cooldown are automatically excluded from urgent alerts."
        },
        {
          q: "Can hospitals register and broadcast urgent needs?",

          q: "How do hospitals integrate FindMyDonor™?",
